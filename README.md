site-setup-tool
===============

This project is an automated site setup tool. It's currently not fully functional - it's missing a lot of configuration information.

It's also currently restricted to collaborators only, but as soon as we've had a chance to clean it up a litte, it will be opened up for anyone to contribute to. 

We'll also be tagging any issues that are an easy starting point with up-for-grabs if you'd like to get involved. 

Our github pages will soon contain a useage/setup/development guide, but if you have questions before that's up, let me know. 

If you've got any questions about this repo - using or contributing - feel free to send me an email or contact me through twitter @harrietgl.
